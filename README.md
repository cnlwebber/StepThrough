# StepThrough

This web-based Algorithm Visualizer is a tool designed to provide interactive and visually appealing visualizations of various algorithms. The project aims to help users understand algorithms through dynamic graphics and animations, highlighting key operations and variable values.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Users can interact with the visualization to control the flow of the algorithm, such as starting, pausing, and resetting.
- **Variable Tracking**: Display key variable values in real-time to understand the algorithm's internal state during execution.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Support for visualizing a variety of algorithms.
- **Customizable Views**: Users can adjust parameters to see how they affect the algorithm's performance and behavior.

## Libraries/Languages Used

- **TypeScript**: Main programming language for structured code and enhanced scalability.
- **D3.js**: Used for complex visual representations and animations.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **Laravel**: For implementing a MVC project structure.

## Usage

Open the application in your web browser to interact with the visualizations. Choose an algorithm from the list, set the parameters as needed, and control the visualization using the provided interface.
